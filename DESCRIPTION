Description: This package aims at doing population growth model fitting in a Bayesian framework, whilst simultaneously saving computing time by parallellising the whole process. Currently, only support is provided for Beverton-Holt population growth models and r-K population growth models, however, further support for other models will be implemented in the near future.
